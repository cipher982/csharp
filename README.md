### Play Mary Had a Little Lamb with console sound!
  -This console file (console hidden parameter) runs in the background and uses a basic sound frequency output to play Mary Had a Little Lamb in the background. Fun to put on a friends computer and really annoy them.
  
## To use:
1. Compile code within your favorite compiler (I used the latest Visual Studio)
2. Click to open program
3. To end it, open task manager and force close, else it will repeat indefinitely!
